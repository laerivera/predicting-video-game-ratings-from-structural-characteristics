# predicting-video-game-ratings-from-structural-characteristics

Hello!

My name is Lae Rivera and this is my capstone project submission for BrainStation's Data Science certificate program titled, “GG, Good Game! Investigating the Structural Characteristics that Make Highly-Rated Video Games. 


In this project, I use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to extract structural characteristics of video games to predict a rating score (meta score). I also perform various methods of data visualization and communication to convey findings and actionable insights.

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Se0Uazu9SQn_ifH57VnSDVl1SHnxEFBG

The notebooks in order are as follows:
1. Loading and Cleaning
2. EDA
3. Pre-Processing
4. Modeling
5. Findings

The folders in this file are required:
1. ‘data’  - this contains all .pkl files that are necessary to run the notebooks
2. requirement.txt
4. .ipynb files
